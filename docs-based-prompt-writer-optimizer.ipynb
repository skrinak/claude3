    "Claude is trained to be a helpful, honest, and harmless assistant. It is used to speaking in dialogue and you can instruct it in regular English.\n",
    "\n",
    "The quality of the instructions you give Claude can have a large effect on the quality of its outputs, especially for complex tasks. This guide to prompt design will help you learn how to craft prompts that produce accurate and consistent results.\n",
    "\n",
    "Claude works by sequence prediction\n",
    "Claude is a conversational assistant, based on a large language model. The model uses all the text that you have sent it (your prompt) and all the text it has generated so far to predict the next token that would be most helpful.\n",
    "\n",
    "This means that Claude constructs its responses one set of characters at a time, in order. It cannot go back and edit its response after it has written it unless you give it a chance to do so in a subsequent prompt.\n",
    "\n",
    "Claude can also only see (and make predictions on) what is in its context window. It can't remember previous conversations unless you put them in the prompt, and it can't open links.\n",
    "\n",
    "What is a prompt?\n",
    "The text that you give Claude is designed to elicit, or \"prompt\", a relevant output. A prompt is usually in the form of a question or instructions. For example:\n",
    "\n",
    "H: Why is the sky blue?\n",
    "\n",
    "The text that Claude responds with is called a \"response\".\n",
    "\n",
    "A: The sky appears blue to us due to how the molecules in the air scatter light from the sun. The shorter wavelength light (blue) scatters more easily than the longer wavelength light (like reds and yellows), so when we look up at the sky, what we see is all the scattered blue light. This is known as Rayleigh scattering. The color of the sky varies based on conditions like the angle of the sun and amount of dust/water in the air, but during the day with a clear sky, the blue wavelength of light is most responsible for the color we perceive.\n",

    "\n",
    "We can also ask Claude to use XML tags in its response. Doing so can make it easy to extract key information in a setting where the output is automatically processed.

    "\n",
    "Set aside (\"hold out\") a test set of inputs\n",
    "When coming up with inputs to test, we recommend having separate sets of \"prompt development data\" and \"test data\". Both (or more) sets should be representative of real inputs.\n",
    "\n",
    "Use your prompt development data to evaluate how well Claude is performing the task as you develop your prompt. Iterate on your prompt until Claude is consistently performing well with this data.\n",
    "\n",
    "Then, to ensure that you're not overfitting to just the prompt development data, you can prompt Claude to complete the task with the test data that it has not yet encountered.\n",
    "\n",
    "(Optional) Generate synthetic data\n",
    "If you want more input data but don't have a lot of it yet, you can prompt a separate instance of Claude to generate additional input text for you to test on! If you explain what good input data looks like and then give a few examples, you can often get more such examples from Claude.\n",
    "\n",
    "Experiment and iterate\n",
    "Refining a prompt can be a lot like performing a series of experiments. You run tests, interpret the results, then adjust a variable (your prompt, or the input) based on the results.\n",
    "\n",
    "When Claude fails a test, try to identify why it failed (having Claude output its thinking in tags is a great way to look into Claude's logic; learn more in our tip for giving Claude room to think). Adjust your prompt to account for that failure point.\n",
    "\n",
    "Adjusting your prompt can involve:\n",
    "\n",
    "Writing rules more explicitly or adding new rules\n",
    "Showing Claude how to process your examples correctly in the prompt itself by adding similar examples and canonical outputs for them to the prompt.\n",
    "When Claude is doing consistently well at one type of input with the new prompt, try it with another input type. Make sure to try out edge cases.\n",
